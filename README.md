## About
This is a simple webpage that allows you to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors against a computer AI. It'll display the result as well as score after every round. Whoever reaches 5 points first will win the game.

## What I Did
This project was my first foray into programming with Javascript. And boy, it was fun, challenging, and frustrating. To be honest, I didn't know where to start at the beginning. I remembered staring at the screen without knowing what to type. But it dawned on me later that this is programming and it's all about solving problems, not typing. So I broke things down into smaller chunks and worked from there. 

I started with a function that randomly chooses between Rock, Paper, and Scissors. I named it getComputerChoice. And that was my "computer" player. The next step was to figure out how to have it played against me for JUST one round (my goal was to play five rounds but let's tackle one round first, shall we?). A few Google searches later, I put together another function called playRound that accomplishes it. That was some progress!

Once I had playRound, things began to look better. I already had the core of the program. All I need was to create a few more functions that keep score and display who the winner is after five rounds. So a few days later, I finished keepScore and displayGameResult. At this point, I had all the smaller problems solved, I just had to put everything together into a big function that allows me to play five rounds with the computer, keeps score, and announces the winner at the end. A few cups of Joe and many hours later, playGame finally worked.

Keep in mind that all these functions went through many iterations because things changed as the program evolved and took shape. It took a lot of googling, reading MDN, and banging my head against the wall (not really!) to get this project done. 

But I'm glad that I did it. I learned that programming is different from coding. Programming is about coming up with a solution for a problem. Programming languages and the act of coding are just the means to get there.

## Installation & Set Up
1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.
2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/rock_paper_scissors.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'rock_paper_scissors.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
```
cd rock_paper_scissors
```
or
```
cd [your-forked-repo-name]
```
